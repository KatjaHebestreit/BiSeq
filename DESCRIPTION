Description: The BiSeq package provides useful classes and functions to
        handle and analyze targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS) data such
        as reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data. In
        particular, it implements an algorithm to detect differentially
        methylated regions (DMRs). The package takes already aligned BS
        data from one or multiple samples.
