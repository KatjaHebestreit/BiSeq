	that is pivotal for gene regulation, cellular specification and cancer
	development. Here, we describe an R package, methylKit, that rapidly
	analyzes genome-wide cytosine epigenetic profiles from high-throughput
	methylation and hydroxymethylation sequencing experiments. methylKit
	includes functions for clustering, sample quality visualization,
	differential methylation analysis and annotation features, thus automating
	and simplifying many of the steps for discerning statistically significant
	bases or regions of DNA methylation. Finally, we demonstrate methylKit
	on breast cancer data, in which we find statistically significant
	regions of differential methylation and stratify tumor subtypes.
	methylKit is available at http://code.google.com/p/methylkit.},

	Abstract = {The linear step-up multiple testing procedure controls the false discovery
	rate at the
	
	desired level q for independent and positively dependent test statistics.
	When all null
	
	hypotheses are true, and the test statistics are independent and continuous,
	the bound is
	
	sharp. When some of the null hypotheses are not true, the procedure
	is conservative by
	
	a factor which is the proportion m /m of the true null hypotheses
	among the hypotheses.
	
	We provide a new two-stage procedure in which the linear step-up procedure
	is used in
	
	stage one to estimate m , providing a new level qâˆž which is used in
	the linear step-up
	
	procedure in the second stage. We prove that a general form of the
	two-stage procedure
	
	controls the false discovery rate at the desired level q. This framework
	enables us to study
	
	analytically the properties of other procedures that exist in the
	literature. A simulation
	
	study is presented that shows that two-stage adaptive procedures improve
	in power over
	
	the original procedure, mainly because they provide tighter control
	of the false discovery
	
	rate. We further study the performance of the current suggestions,
	some variations of the
	
	procedures, and previous suggestions, in the case where the test statistics
	are positively
	
	dependent, a case for which the original procedure controls the false
	discovery rate. In
	
	the setting studied here the newly proposed two-stage procedure is
	the only one that
	
	controls the false discovery rate. The procedures are illustrated
	with two examples of

	Abstract = {Cytosine-5 methylation within CpG dinucleotides is a potentially important
	mechanism of epigenetic influence on human traits and disease. In
	addition to influences of age and gender, genetic control of DNA
	methylation levels has recently been described. We used whole blood
	genomic DNA in a twin set (23 MZ twin-pairs and 23 DZ twin-pairs,
	N = 92) as well as healthy controls (N = 96) to investigate heritability
	and relationship with age and gender of selected DNA methylation
	profiles using readily commercially available GoldenGate bead array
	technology. Despite the inability to detect meaningful methylation
	differences in the majority of CpG loci due to tissue type and locus
	selection issues, we found replicable significant associations of
	DNA methylation with age and gender. We identified associations of
	genetically heritable single nucleotide polymorphisms with large
	differences in DNA methylation levels near the polymorphism (cis
	effects) as well as associations with much smaller differences in
	DNA methylation levels elsewhere in the human genome (trans effects).
	Our results demonstrate the feasibility of array-based approaches
	in studies of DNA methylation and highlight the vast differences
	between individual loci. The identification of CpG loci of which
	DNA methylation levels are under genetic control or are related to
	age or gender will facilitate further studies into the role of DNA
	methylation and disease.},

	stem cells obstructs differentiation; however, the role of these
	enzymes in somatic stem cells is largely unknown. Using conditional
	ablation, we show that Dnmt3a loss progressively impairs hematopoietic

	simultaneously expanding HSC numbers in the bone marrow. Dnmt3a-null
	HSCs show both increased and decreased methylation at distinct loci,
	including substantial CpG island hypermethylation. Dnmt3a-null HSCs
	upregulate HSC multipotency genes and downregulate differentiation
	factors, and their progeny exhibit global hypomethylation and incomplete
	repression of HSC-specific genes. These data establish Dnmt3a as
	a critical participant in the epigenetic silencing of HSC regulatory
	genes, thereby enabling efficient differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Bisulfite sequencing using next generation sequencers yields genome-wide
	measurements of DNA methylation at single nucleotide resolution.
	Traditional aligners are not designed for mapping bisulfite-treated
	reads, where the unmethylated Cs are converted to Ts. We have developed
	BS Seeker, an approach that converts the genome to a three-letter
	alphabet and uses Bowtie to align bisulfite-treated reads to a reference
	genome. It uses sequence tags to reduce mapping ambiguity. Post-processing
	of the alignments removes non-unique and low-quality mappings.We
	tested our aligner on synthetic data, a bisulfite-converted Arabidopsis
	library, and human libraries generated from two different experimental
	protocols. We evaluated the performance of our approach and compared
	it to other bisulfite aligners. The results demonstrate that among
	the aligners tested, BS Seeker is more versatile and faster. When
	mapping to the human genome, BS Seeker generates alignments significantly
	faster than RMAP and BSMAP. Furthermore, BS Seeker is the only alignment
	tool that can explicitly account for tags which are generated by
	certain library construction protocols.BS Seeker provides fast and
	accurate mapping of bisulfite-converted reads. It can work with BS
	reads generated from the two different experimental protocols, and
	is able to efficiently map reads to large mammalian genomes. The
	Python program is freely available at http://pellegrini.mcdb.ucla.edu/BS_Seeker/BS_Seeker.html.},

@article{Das2004,
	Abstract = {DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription, and
	its role in carcinogenesis has been a topic of considerable interest
	in the last few years. Alterations in DNA methylation are common
	in a variety of tumors as well as in development. Of all epigenetic
	modifications, hypermethylation, which represses transcription of
	the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing,
	has been most extensively studied. However, global hypomethylation
	has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. New information
	concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to
	the discovery of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. The contribution
	of dietary folate and methylene terahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms
	to methylation patterns in normal and cancer tissues is under intense
	investigation. As methylation occurs early and can be detected in
	body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors
	and for determining the prognosis. Because DNA methylation is reversible,
	drugs like 5'-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors
	are being used to treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating
	agents such as antisense DNA methyl transferase and small interference
	RNA are being developed, making the field of DNA methylation wider

	Abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics
	derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem.
	With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some

	but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni)
	tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This
	paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures
	for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical
	work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will
	be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures
	operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine
	which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation
	of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of

	Abstract = {DNA methylation is a heritable and stable epigenetic mark associated
	with transcriptional repression. Changes in the patterns and levels
	of global and regional DNA methylation regulate development and contribute
	directly to disease states such as cancer. Recent findings provide
	intriguing insights into the epigenetic crosstalk between DNA methylation,
	histone modifications, and small interfering RNAs in the control
	of cell development and carcinogenesis. In this review, we summarize
	the recent studies in DNA methylation primarily focusing on the interplay
	between different epigenetic modifications and their potential role
	in gene silencing in development and disease. Although the molecular
	mechanisms involved in the epigenetic crosstalk are not fully understood,
	unraveling their precise regulation is important not only for understanding
	the underpinnings of cellular development and cancer, but also for
	the design of clinically relevant and efficient therapeutics using

@article{Jaffe2012,
	Abstract = {During the past 5 years, high-throughput technologies have been successfully
	used by epidemiology studies, but almost all have focused on sequence
	variation through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Today,
	the study of other genomic events is becoming more common in large-scale
	epidemiological studies. Many of these, unlike the single-nucleotide
	polymorphism studied in GWAS, are continuous measures. In this context,
	the exercise of searching for regions of interest for disease is
	akin to the problems described in the statistical 'bump hunting'
	literature.New statistical challenges arise when the measurements
	are continuous rather than categorical, when they are measured with
	uncertainty, and when both biological signal, and measurement errors
	are characterized by spatial correlation along the genome. Perhaps
	the most challenging complication is that continuous genomic data
	from large studies are measured throughout long periods, making them
	susceptible to 'batch effects'. An example that combines all three
	characteristics is genome-wide DNA methylation measurements. Here,
	we present a data analysis pipeline that effectively models measurement
	error, removes batch effects, detects regions of interest and attaches
	statistical uncertainty to identified regions.We illustrate the usefulness
	of our approach by detecting genomic regions of DNA methylation associated
	with a continuous trait in a well-characterized population of newborns.
	Additionally, we show that addressing unexplained heterogeneity like
	batch effects reduces the number of false-positive regions.Our framework
	offers a comprehensive yet flexible approach for identifying genomic
	regions of biological interest in large epidemiological studies using

	Numerous platforms including tiling arrays and next generation sequencing,

	Similar to other tiling array data, DNA methylation data shares the
	characteristics of inherent correlation structure among nearby probes.
	However, unlike gene expression or protein DNA binding data, the
	varying CpG density which gives rise to CpG island, shore and shelf
	definition provides exogenous information in detecting differential
	methylation. This article aims to introduce a robust testing and
	probe ranking procedure based on a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model
	that incorporates the above-mentioned features for detecting differential

	393-424) and propose modeling the nonnull using a nonparametric symmetric
	distribution in two-sided hypothesis testing. We show that this model

	methylome and analysis of the unique sequences in human peripheral

	that non-CpG cytosine methylation is minor in human PBMC. Analysis
	of the PBMC methylome revealed a rich epigenomic landscape for 20
	distinct genomic features, including regulatory, protein-coding,
	non-coding, RNA-coding, and repeat sequences. Integration of our

	Abstract = {Approaches for the analysis of statistical parametric maps (SPMs)
	can be crudely grouped into three main categories in which different
	philosophies are applied to delineate activated regions. These being
	type I error control thresholding, false discovery rate (FDR) control
	thresholding and posterior probability thresholding. To better understand
	the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation
	study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data
	sets. Using default settings, we find that posterior probability
	thresholding is the most powerful approach, and type I error control
	thresholding provides the lowest levels of type I error. False discovery
	rate control thresholding performs in between the other approaches
	for both these criteria, although for some parameter settings this
	approach can approximate the performance of posterior probability
	thresholding. Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits
	of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal approach.
	We conclude that viewing the problem of delineating areas of activation
	as a classification problem provides a highly interpretable framework
	for comparing the methods. Within this framework, we highlight the
	role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of
	errors that may occur in a given analysis.},

	patterns. BglII restriction fragments were size-selected to 500-600
	bp, equipped with adapters, treated with bisulfite, PCR amplified,
	cloned and sequenced. We constructed RRBS libraries from murine ES
	cells and from ES cells lacking DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and
	3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]).
	Sequencing of 960 RRBS clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells
	generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212
	cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted
	to uracil indicating a conversion rate of >99.9\%. Of the remaining
	cytosines 35 were found in CpG and 3 in CpT dinucleotides. Non-CpG
	methylation was >250-fold reduced compared with wild-type ES cells,
	consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in CpA and CpT methylation.
	Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the
	methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation
	in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific
	maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete

	Abstract = {Cytosine DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications
	and influences gene expression, developmental processes, X-chromosome
	inactivation, and genomic imprinting. Aberrant methylation is furthermore
	known to be associated with several diseases including cancer. The
	gold standard to determine DNA methylation on genome-wide scales
	is 'bisulfite sequencing': DNA fragments are treated with sodium
	bisulfite resulting in the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into
	uracils, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. The resulting
	sequencing reads thus exhibit asymmetric bisulfite-related mismatches
	and suffer from an effective reduction of the alphabet size in the
	unmethylated regions, rendering the mapping of bisulfite sequencing
	reads computationally much more demanding. As a consequence, currently
	available read mapping software often fails to achieve high sensitivity
	and in many cases requires unrealistic computational resources to
	cope with large real-life datasets.In this study, we present a seed-based
	approach based on enhanced suffix arrays in conjunction with Myers
	bit-vector algorithm to efficiently extend seeds to optimal semi-global
	alignments while allowing for bisulfite-related substitutions. It
	outperforms most current approaches in terms of sensitivity and performs

	Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) has revolutionized the
	study of linking physical stimuli with localized brain activity.
	Among the challenges of working with FMRI data, they are noisy, they
	exhibit spatial correlation, and they are usually large containing
	tens of thousands of voxels of information. The notion of False Discovery
	Rate (FDR) has made a great impact on how to perform powerful multiple
	hypothesis tests to detect signals in such large multivariate data.
	The spatial dependence in FMRI data requires special care since,
	if ignored, it can lead to a loss of control of size as well as a
	deterioration in power of FDR procedures. This article advocates
	transforming the voxel-wise test statistics to wavelet space, where
	the coefficients are approximately uncorrelated. We demonstrate,
	through a series of experiments, that an FDR procedure in wavelet
	space enhanced by P-value adaptive thresholding (EPAT), maintains
	control of the size of the multiple-testing procedure and offers
	substantially increased power over an FDR procedure that is applied
	directly to the map of (spatially dependent) test statistics. The
	EPAT methodology, developed here for FMRI data, is generic and can
	be applied in other dependent data settings.}},

	SUZ12 and REST binding sites identified in embryonic stem cells were,

	PML-RARÎ± binding sites were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation
	in APL. In line, myeloid cells from pre-leukemic PML-RARÎ± knock-in

	seeks a compromise between efficiency, generality, validity, simplicity,
	and execution speed. The main differences between this analysis and
	previous ones are: a simple bias reduction and regularization for
	voxel-wise autoregressive model parameters; the combination of effects
	and their estimated standard deviations across different runs/sessions/subjects
	via a hierarchical random effects analysis using the EM algorithm;
	overcoming the problem of a small number of runs/session/subjects
	using a regularized variance ratio to increase the degrees of freedom.},

	Abstract = {We report new random field theory P values for peaks of canonical

	for multivariate image data. This completes results for all types
	of univariate and multivariate image data analysis. All other known
	univariate and multivariate random field theory results are now special
	cases, so these new results present a true unification of all currently
	known results. As an illustration, we use these results in a deformation-based
	morphometry (DBM) analysis to look for regions of the brain where
	vector deformations of nonmissile trauma patients are related to
	several verbal memory scores, to detect regions of changes in anatomical
	effective connectivity between the trauma patients and a group of
	age- and sex-matched controls, and to look for anatomical connectivity
	in cortical thickness.},

@article{Xi2012,
	Abstract = {Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a powerful yet
	cost-efficient method for studying DNA methylation on a genomic scale.
	RRBS involves restriction-enzyme digestion, bisulfite conversion
	and size selection, resulting in DNA sequencing data that require
	special bioinformatic handling. Here, we describe RRBSMAP, a short-read
	alignment tool that is designed for handling RRBS data in a user-friendly
	and scalable way. RRBSMAP uses wildcard alignment, and avoids the
	need for any preprocessing or post-processing steps. We benchmarked
	RRBSMAP against a well-validated MAQ-based pipeline for RRBS read
	alignment and observed similar accuracy but much improved runtime
	performance, easier handling and better scaling to large sample sets.
	In summary, RRBSMAP removes bioinformatic hurdles and reduces the
	computational burden of large-scale epigenome association studies
	performed with RRBS.http://rrbsmap.computational-epigenetics.org/
	http://code.google.com/p/bsmap/wl1@bcm.tmc.eduSupplementary data

@article{Zackay2010,
	Abstract = {Exploration of DNA methylation and its impact on various regulatory
	mechanisms has become a very active field of research. Simultaneously
	there is an arising need for tools to process and analyse the data
	together with statistical investigation and visualisation.MethVisual
	is a new application that enables exploratory analysis and intuitive
	visualization of DNA methylation data as is typically generated by
	bisulfite sequencing. The package allows the import of DNA methylation
	sequences, aligns them and performs quality control comparison. It
	comprises basic analysis steps as lollipop visualization, co-occurrence
	display of methylation of neighbouring and distant CpG sites, summary
	statistics on methylation status, clustering and correspondence analysis.
	The package has been developed for methylation data but can be also
	used for other data types for which binary coding can be inferred.
	The application of the package, as well as a comparison to existing
	DNA methylation analysis tools and its workflow based on two datasets
	is presented in this paper.The R package MethVisual offers various
	analysis procedures for data that can be binarized, in particular
	for bisulfite sequenced methylation data. R/Bioconductor has become
	one of the most important environments for statistical analysis of
	various types of biological and medical data. Therefore, any data
	analysis within R that allows the integration of various data types
	as provided from different technological platforms is convenient.
	It is the first and so far the only specific package for DNA methylation
	analysis, in particular for bisulfite sequenced data available in
	R/Bioconductor enviroment. The package is available for free at http://methvisual.molgen.mpg.de/
	and from the Bioconductor Consortium http://www.bioconductor.org.},
