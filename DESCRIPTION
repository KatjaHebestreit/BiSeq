Description: The BiSeq package provides useful classes and functions to handle and analyze targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS) data such as reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data. In particular, it implements an algorithm to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The package takes already aligned BS data from one or multiple samples.
